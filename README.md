# üíì Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical data.  
It is an **end-to-end Machine Learning project**, covering **data preprocessing, model training, API deployment, and UI development.**  

‚úÖ **Machine Learning Model** trained using RandomForest & optimized with GridSearchCV  
‚úÖ **Flask API** to serve model predictions  
‚úÖ **Streamlit UI** for an interactive user interface  
‚úÖ **Deployed on Render (API) and Streamlit Cloud (UI)**
